Six months ago, he was hospitalized for acute decompensation of heart failure and his medication was adjusted. He says that he has had difficulties remembering his medication regimen. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone, and metformin. He is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31 kg/m2. Pulse is 89/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 135/83 mm Hg.

Transthoracic echocardiography shows increased sizes of the left atrium and ventricle, diastolic dysfunction, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 0.55.
