This patient's laboratory studies show a decrease in platelet count of less than 30% within the first 5 days of initiating heparin therapy, which is suggestive of nonimmune heparin-associated thrombocytopenia, also known as type 1 heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition is common, occurring in approximately 10-30% of patients treated with heparin, and is self-limiting. It poses a negligible risk for thrombosis. Therefore, the patient should continue heparin therapy to maintain an aPTT 1.5–2.5 times normal until he begins a suitable longer-term anticoagulant to fully treat his DVT.\\n\\nOption A, switching to enoxaparin, is incorrect because enoxaparin is primarily eliminated via the kidneys and is contraindicated if the estimated GFR is < 30 mL/min.
